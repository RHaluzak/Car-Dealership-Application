# Car-Dealership-Application
This is source code for a Universal Windows Application for car dealership application. The application would communicate with an Azure easy table to authenticate users. The user could then view the vehicles offered by the dealership and also view information about the dealership itself. Only source code was included due to the 100 file limit. Azure services have been disabled as of 7/13/2018
